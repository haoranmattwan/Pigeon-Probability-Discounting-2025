## Project Overview

This study examined how pigeons discount probabilistic food rewards using a novel combination of concurrent-chains and adjusting-amount procedures. This ensured that the probabilities experienced by the pigeons matched the programmed probabilities. The primary goals were to determine if the hyperboloid discounting function accurately describes pigeon choice behavior under uncertainty and to investigate the effect of reward magnitude on the degree of discounting.

* **Experiment 1** involved choices between a smaller, certain reward and a larger, probabilistic reward.
* **Experiment 2** extended this to choices between two probabilistic rewards, where the probabilities of both were reduced by a common factor (multiplier).

The analysis relies heavily on Bayesian nonlinear multilevel models implemented via `brms` (in R) and `pymc` (in Python) to estimate subject-level discounting parameters.

## Repository Structure

The project materials are organized into the following folders:

* **/Analysis**: Contains the primary analysis scripts replicating the findings.
    * `analysis_R.qmd`: A Quarto document with the complete **R** code, demonstrating data processing derived from the OSF dataset, fitting custom nonlinear Bayesian beta regression models (`brms`), generating posterior predictions, calculating Bayesian R-squared, and performing amount effect tests (`glmmTMB`).
    * `analysis_Py.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook providing a direct **Python** translation of the R analysis, using `pandas` for data handling, `pymc` for Bayesian modeling, `arviz` for results interpretation, and `statsmodels` for auxiliary tests (like GEE).
* **/Figure**: Contains the figures generated by the analysis scripts, matching those in the publication.

## Methodological Approach

The analysis employs several advanced statistical techniques to model the behavioral data from both experiments:

* **Bayesian Nonlinear Multilevel Models**: Custom hyperboloid discounting functions (both a standard version for Experiment 1 and a generalized version for Experiment 2) were implemented within a Bayesian hierarchical framework. This approach estimates individual subject parameters while appropriately accounting for the repeated-measures data structure.
* **Beta Regression**: A beta distribution was used as the likelihood in the Bayesian models to correctly handle the relative subjective value data, which are proportions bounded between 0 and 1.
* **Model Validation**: Bayesian R-squared was calculated from the posterior predictive distribution to assess model fit at the subject level. Posterior predictions were also used to generate the model-based discounting curves shown in the figures.
* **Atheoretical Analysis**: The Area under the Curve (AuC) was calculated as a theory-neutral measure of discounting to provide a complementary analysis of the effect of reward magnitude.
* **Hypothesis Testing**: A generalized linear mixed model (in R) and a Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) model (in Python) were used to formally test for the effect of reward amount on AuC while accounting for the non-independence of observations within subjects.
